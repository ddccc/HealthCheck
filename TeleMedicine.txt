Tele-medicine tool application project
======================================

Tele-medicine addresses the need for advice when a medical facility is
not locally available.  Support using a web site can be a just a
form of self-help or involve additional human assistance as we see
these days with call-centers.  Our HealthCheck system can switch
seamless from self-help to human assistance.  Expert assistance is
offered in two versions:
1.	real-time with a call-center and
2.	delayed where the patient's physician is notified.  

In all versions, the system does an interview by querying symptoms
that is the basis for a "pre-diagnosis" (for lack of a better term) in
the self-help version.  The system's interview can be taken over at
any time by an attending physician in the call-center version.
Call-center displays generate a notification when a life-threatening
condition is conjectured.  Hence, unlike in a traditional call-center,
the attending agent/physician can skip the initial querying of the
patient.  Disease conjectures are created while the patient history is
updated as well.

Communication modalities are web browsers and the phone with
speech recognition technology.  The latter modality is still a
prototype version in contrast with the browser version which is
online since around 2005.  The web version with human assistance
through a call-center is online also since 2005, although without
call-center personel.

The project's goal is testing the adequacy of the call-center
version.  Different test settings can be considered:
- Users having access to an internet connection 
- Users do not have access to the internet but there is a facility
with internet access. Non internet-literate users would have to be
assisted through an intermediary person.


Some technical data of the HealthCheck system
---------------------------------------------
Site: www.healthcheck4me.info
658 diseases
928 symptoms
236 locations
102 body systems
 83 abnormal conditions
153 external causes
Localization is relatively easy.  Current there are English & Dutch
versions. 
One-on-one interaction with a call-center physician is now chat based
and lacks speech & video; a parallel skype session would provide this
functionality as a stop-gap solution.
Porting to an (android) phone requires substantial modification of the
GUI.
